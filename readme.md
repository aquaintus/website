In this fast paced, socially interconnected society there is a growing problem of people losing touch. Due to the sheer magnitude of new people we meet on a regular basis, we are managing 10x more contacts and information than we were 5 years ago. There is a tonne of information to remember about each new person and so many ways to reach out to them. It is easy to forget about your existing friends and connections and miss out on opportunities to build new, strong relationships. Surely, there is a way?
Aquaintus: A platform that inspires social interaction between your new and existing friendship circles by harnessing the power of contact relation managers and the interconnectivity of social networks.
Aquaintus allows you to see your relationships quickly and easily without being bombarded with useless information. It uses gamification principles to highlight those connections that are growing weak and provide incentive to act. 
Aquaintus is a tool with the sole purpose to make you a better friend. So when you feel like you are losing touch or just being overwhelmed by social networks, think of Aquaintus: Your friendly reminder.
